# s_tagebuech
[Preview](res/preview.png)
A minimal diary for digitizing and displaying hand-drawn line art sketches. Realized with OpenCV and Autotrace and ready to be deployed on Google Cloud.
The application takes a photo of a sketch and parameterizes the lines and segemnts the background to display it in a lightweight SVG.

The idea of s_tagebuch is to combine sketch entries such that the incoming and outgoing strokes align, creating a continuous horizont.
